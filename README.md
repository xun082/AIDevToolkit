## Usage Guide

### 1. Installation

Ensure your Node.js version is v18 or above, and globally install create-ai-toolkit:

```bash
npm install -g ai-scaffold-toolkit
# or using pnpm
pnpm add -g ai-scaffold-toolkit
```

### 2. Add API Key

If you don't have a GPT key, you can purchase one from the [OpenAI Official Website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### 3. Set API Key

To use create-ai-toolkit, first execute the following command to globally set the API Key:

```bash
ai set OPENAI_KEY your-key
```

This command will create a `toolkit.config.json` file in the root directory of your operating system.

### 4. View Help

Execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
ai --help
```

You will see the following result:

## Feature Demonstrations

### 1. Automatic Component Generation

Execute the following command to automatically generate a component:

```bash
ai component <name> [path]
```

Where `name` is the component name, and `path` is an optional parameter specifying the path to generate the file, defaulting to the `src/components` directory.

Execute the command and select based on your needs, the final result is shown below:

### 2. Custom Hook Generation

Execute the following command to generate custom hooks:

```bash
ai hooks <name>
```

Where `name` is the name of the hooks file, defaulting to the `src/hooks` directory.

Execute the command and select based on your needs, the final result is shown below:

### 3. Automatic Commit Message Generation

To generate commit messages, first ensure there is content in your git staging area. Execute the following command to add modified files to the staging area:

```bash
git add .
```

After ensuring there is content in the staging area, execute the following command:

```bash
ai commit
```

The terminal will return appropriate commit messages for you to choose from:

If you select a satisfactory commit message, the tool will automatically execute `git commit -m 'generated commit message'`.

### 4. Automatic Code Review

Based on the content of the staging area, AI will automatically perform a code review and provide modification suggestions. Execute the following command:

```bash
ai review
```

After executing the command, AI will automatically generate a `moment.md` file containing AI's evaluation and modification suggestions:

## Configuration

### Change API Key

If you need to change the API Key, you can execute the following command:

```bash
ai set OPENAI_KEY your-key
```

### Get Current API Key

Execute the following command to get the currently set API Key:

```bash
ai get OPENAI_KEY
```

### Change API Endpoint

If you are using a different intermediary API Key or running a large model on your machine, you can execute the following command to change the API endpoint:

```bash
ai set END_POINT http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
